# Chinese-Word-Semantic-Relation-Classification
Word semantic relation classification is a challenging task for natural language processing, so we organize a semantic campaign on this task at NLPCC 2017. The dataset covers four kinds of semantic relations (synonym, antonym, hyponym and meronym), and there are 500 word pairs per category. Together 17 teams submit their results.
